
## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

First run the following command:
```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
```
To run it in the browser use the following command:
```bash
$ ionic serve

```
To run it in on a phone, use the following command (only android, since ceritfcates needs to be setup up in order to run it on ios):
```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add android
$ ionic cordova run android
```
